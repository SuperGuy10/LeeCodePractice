/*
Given a Weather table, write a SQL query to find all dates' Ids with higher temperature compared to its previous (yesterday's) dates.

+---------+------------------+------------------+
| Id(INT) | RecordDate(DATE) | Temperature(INT) |
+---------+------------------+------------------+
|       1 |       2015-01-01 |               10 |
|       2 |       2015-01-02 |               25 |
|       3 |       2015-01-03 |               20 |
|       4 |       2015-01-04 |               30 |
+---------+------------------+------------------+
For example, return the following Ids for the above Weather table:

+----+
| Id |
+----+
|  2 |
|  4 |
+----+

# Write your MySQL query statement below
SELECT B.Id
FROM Weather AS A, Weather AS B
WHERE TO_DAYS(B.RecordDate) - TO_DAYS(A.RecordDate) = 1 # change date value to days number in a year
AND B.Temperature > A.Temperature


# Solution 2
SELECT
    weather.id AS 'Id'
FROM
    weather
        JOIN
    weather w ON DATEDIFF(weather.date, w.date) = 1
        AND weather.Temperature > w.Temperature
        
# EATEDIFF(DATE1,DATE2) = VALUE :use to finde the difference between two date values
